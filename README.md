# Stock Price Prediction

This repository contains a project for predicting stock prices using machine learning. The project uses historical stock data to train a predictive model that can forecast future stock prices.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict the closing price of a stock based on its historical data. The model is trained using linear regression, a popular machine learning algorithm for predictive analysis.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and test sets.
- **Model Training**: Using linear regression to train the model on historical stock data.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.

## Dependencies
-Python 3.x
-Jupyter Notebook
-NumPy
-Pandas
-Scikit-learn

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using:

<b>Mean Squared Error (MSE):</b> Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.

<b>R-squared Score:</b> Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

<b>The results show that the model performs well on the test data, making it a useful tool for stock price prediction.</b>
